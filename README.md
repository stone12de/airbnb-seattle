## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using AirBnB data from Seattle in 2016 to better understand:

1. How the AirBnB-Market is in Seattle,
2. how written reviews can be used for data analysis,
3. how the price can be predicted using a data-based models.

The full set of files related to this course can be download from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle)

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here that contains all calculations, together with detailed information and all graphs. All 3 questions with sub-questions are addressed specificly. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found directly in the notebook and at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@stone12_49671/how-data-helps-on-vacation-9a82f65c1b1e).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to AirBnB for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
